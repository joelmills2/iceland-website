                <p> This website provides an in-depth exploration of the geology of Iceland,
                    a land shaped by the forces of tectonic plates, volcanoes, and glaciers.
                    Designed for the final project of the GEOL104 course at Queen’s
                    University, this website offers a comprehensive introduction to the
                    geological features and processes that have shaped Iceland’s landscape.
                    <br><br>
                    The website begins by examining the plate tectonic forces that created
                    Iceland, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that runs through the country, and the
                    stationary hotspot beneath the ridge. It then explores Iceland’s diverse
                    array of volcanoes, discussing the volcanic structures as well as
                    eruption types.
                    <br><br>
                    We then look at Iceland’s glaciers, and discuss the wondrous
                    interactions between glaciers and volcanoes, which can lead to mass
                    glacial flooding. We also consider the role that glaciers play in
                    shaping Iceland's landscape, and the threats they face from climate
                    change.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, we explore the geological history of iceland, where we learn
                    how Iceland was formed with a focus on the country’s glacial history.
                    Throughout the website, images, diagrams and figures are used to help
                    illustrate key concepts and geological processes. By the end of this
                    website, users will have gained a thorough understanding of the unique
                    geology of iceland, and how it can inform our understanding of geology
                    more broadly.

                    The geology of Iceland is one of a kind, displaying various unique
                    features and landforms that can only be found together because of
                    Iceland’s plate tectonics. Iceland sits above the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,
                    a giant rift valley and a mountain range that separates the Eurasian
                    and North American plates<sup>5</sup>. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is famous as its
                    discovery led to the development and widespread recognition of the
                    theory of seafloor spreading<sup>6</sup>. Iceland also lays on top of the much
                    smaller and less significant Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Islands ridge<sup>5</sup>.
                    These ridges, along with the presence of a stationary hotspot beneath
                    Iceland, are the cause of Iceland’s wondrous landforms and extreme
                    seismic and volcanic activity<sup>5</sup>.
                    <br><br>
                    The location of Iceland on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which represents
                    a divergent plate boundary, results in the separation of Iceland into
                    two distinct tectonic plates; the Eurasian plate to the east and the
                    North American plate to the west<sup>5</sup>. Each year, the plates diverge
                    approximately 19 mm from one another<sup>7</sup>, expanding Iceland at half the
                    rate of a fingernail. The consistent formation of new crust at the
                    ridge has resulted in Iceland’s rocks being relatively young at 25
                    million years old<sup>5</sup>. The superimposition of the ridge and hotspot
                    generates a diverse range of geological features, including various
                     faults, folds, and intrusions that characterize different regions
                    of Iceland.
                    <br><br>
                    Divergent plate boundaries are known for their oblique nature,
                    resulting in normal faulting and diking along the ridge, particularly
                    in volcanic systems like the Northern Volcanic Zone<sup>7</sup>. These volcanic
                    systems frequently display gradual synforms that incline strata towards
                    the rift zone<sup>7</sup>, while an anticlinal formation can be found between the
                    Eastern and Western Volcanic Zones<sup>5</sup>. Along with volcanism, divergent
                    boundaries are also associated with major seismic activity due to
                    faulting<sup>7</sup>. The valley separating the two diverging plates is a
                    deformation zone and experiences various crustal movements along
                    its axis<sup>7</sup>. In the South Iceland Seismic Zone, high-pressure
                    strike-slip faults are common and can result in earthquakes
                    ranging up to magnitude 7<sup>7</sup>. In the northern part of the deformation
                    zone, strike-slip transform faults occur roughly perpendicular to
                    the ridge in a manner similar to tilting books on a bookshelf, giving
                    rise to the term "bookshelf faulting"<sup>7</sup>. The Icelandic volcanic zones
                    exhibit these features to varying degrees, with some being inactive
                    volcanoes displaying significant faulting, while others are simply
                    mounds of volcanic material due to frequent eruptions<sup>7</sup>.
                    <br><br>
                    Iceland's unique location atop a mantle plume and a diverging boundary
                    has resulted in the formation of remarkable geological structures that
                    cannot be found anywhere else in the world, making it a fascinating
                    and unique destination for geologists and travellers alike.

                    Iceland’s location on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge along with the hotspot
                    located below it, make it one of the most volcanically active places
                    on Earth<sup>7</sup>. Iceland's volcanic activity has had a profound impact on
                    its landscape, shaping its rugged mountains, lava fields, and hot
                    springs, and creating some of the most dramatic and awe-inspiring
                    natural wonders in the world.
                    <br><br>
                    Iceland’s 30 volcanic systems<sup>8</sup> cover roughly one-third of the entire
                    landmass and can be categorized into 5 region-specific groups<sup>9</sup>. The
                    Icelandic volcanic belts comprise 11 volcanoes, while the volcanic
                    zones contain 19. Six are located in the Western Volcanic Zone, five
                    in the Northern Volcanic Zone, three in the Reykjanes Volcanic Zone,
                    and eight in the Eastern Volcanic Zone<sup>8</sup>. Since the tectonic features
                    in each of these zones differ, Iceland’s volcanoes fit into a diverse
                    array of structural classifications, from simple fissures to massive
                    shield volcanoes<sup>9</sup>. Just 17% of Iceland’s volcanoes fit into the
                    classification of a shield volcano, and many share characteristics
                    of both shield and stratovolcanoes<sup>9</sup>. Iceland’s stratovolcanoes are
                    topped with cone-shaped calderas or craters<sup>9</sup> Iceland's volcanic
                    landscape can be characterized by long rows of cone-shaped volcanoes;
                    these basalt volcanoes line tunnels through the subterranean expanse
                    of Iceland and erupt with varying degrees of explosiveness.
                    <br><br>
                    Just as the structures of Iceland’s volcanoes vary, so too do the sizes
                    and explosiveness of their eruptions. The volcanic eruptions in
                    Iceland can be effusive, explosive, or both<sup>10</sup>. Of the recorded
                    eruptions, 78% have been explosive, while 9% have been effusive, and
                    13% have been a combination of the two<sup>9</sup>. The explosive eruptions can
                    be further classified as wet or dry eruptions, with subtypes of
                    Surtseyan, Phreatoplinian, and Plinian eruptions<sup>9</sup>. Due to the abundance
                    of glaciers and volcanoes in Iceland, it is common for these landforms
                    to intersect, leading to volcanic eruptions beneath glaciers<sup>8</sup>.
                    Consequently, these interactions can result in the melting of large
                    portions of ice and may generate mass flooding<sup>8</sup>.
                    <br><br>
                    Among the four volcanic zones, the Eastern Volcanic Zone (EVZ) is the
                    most active zone by a considerable margin. Out of the 205 recorded
                    eruptions, approximately 80% have occurred in this zone<sup>9</sup>. Furthermore,
                    of the 9 volcanoes in this zone 8 have been active<sup>9</sup>.
                    The EVZ also contains four active volcanoes: the Grímsvötn, Veidivötn,
                    Hekla and Katla volcanoes. On the other hand, the Northern Volcanic
                    Zone has had only three of its five volcanoes active, while the Western
                    and Reykjanes Volcanic Zones have had just four of their nine volcanoes
                    active in the past 1100 years<sup>9</sup>.
                    <br><br>
                    In contemporary times, the Icelandic volcanoes have garnered attention
                    as fascinating marvels, rather than as hazardous natural phenomena.
                    This is the case because the frequency of fatalities caused by these
                    volcanoes is exceedingly low, and the deposition of tephra typically
                    results in negligible harm, as the proximate regions are frequently
                    uninhabited<sup>8</sup>.
                    <br><br>
                    Iceland's volcanic activity is a unique and awe-inspiring natural
                    wonder, and with a diverse range of volcanoes and eruptions, their
                    volcanoes attract thousands of visitors and geologists to Iceland each
                    year.

                    Glaciers are a fundamental aspect of Iceland’s natural beauty and wonder.
                    Glaciers are generally deemed inactive as they move at a rate that is too
                    slow to be observed; however, Icelandic glaciers display an exceptional
                    phenomenon as they incur sudden movements called surges. Despite their vast
                    size, Icelandic glaciers have gradually diminished over time. Just 200 years
                    ago, glaciers and sea ice had covered and surrounded practically all of
                    Iceland’s land mass<sup>6</sup>, whereas presently they cover roughly 10% of
                    the island<sup>5</sup>. While geologists typically investigate the annual variations in
                    the glaciers' dimensions caused by temperature fluctuations, it is the surges
                    that distinguish Icelandic glaciers from one another and other glaciers in the
                    world.
                    <br><br>
                    Glacier surges are events characterized by a sudden increase in glacier
                    velocity due to an upsurge in meltwater below<sup>5</sup>. Surge-type glaciers are a
                    characteristic of Icelandic glaciers as there are 26 of them ranging in
                    size from 0.5km to 1500km<sup>5</sup>. Surge-type glaciers are especially common in
                    major ice caps due to the presence of volcanic systems in Iceland<sup>10</sup>. The
                    abundance of volcanoes and glaciers in Iceland leads to dangerous interactions
                    between the two landforms. Many active volcanoes form below glaciers, and
                    eruptions lead to rapid melting and subsequent surges<sup>6</sup>. Surges have numerous
                    effects on Iceland's landforms and the environment. Surges affect the
                    hydrology of Iceland as they increase the mass of the glacier and by
                    extension, the distance they are pushed<sup>10</sup>. Furthermore, surges can cause
                    massive flooding events called Jökulhlaup when a well of meltwater breaks
                    out from below the glacier<sup>6</sup>. These effects pose significant environmental
                    hazards to local populations<sup>6</sup>. Although surges can be hazardous when active,
                    long-term observations reveal that surges occur at regular intervals
                    depending on the properties of the glacier and their environment, enabling
                    geologists to predict these events and respond accordingly<sup>10</sup>. Surge
                    glaciers also possess a very shallow slope when compared to other glacier
                    types at just 1.6 to 4 degrees<sup>10</sup>. The most notable example of a surge-type
                    glacier in Iceland is the Vatnajökull ice cap. This glacier is the largest
                    ice cap in Iceland, and due to its location above a volcanic system, it
                    incurs a multitude of surges<sup>10</sup>. Other Icelandic glaciers tend to follow
                    similar trends to those of other glaciers around the world; they experience
                    an annual advance and retreat and undergo similar long-term changes in mass.
                    <br><br>
                    Icelandic glaciers are unique due to the prominence of surge-type glaciers
                    and their interactions with volcanic systems. Due to these unique processes
                    glaciers are a fundamental aspect of Iceland’s natural awe and beauty and
                    are considered a requisite destination for tourists and geologists alike.

                    Despite its remarkable geological diversity, Iceland is relatively
                    young in geological terms. The island's origins can be traced back
                    approximately 60 million years ago when submarine tectonic and volcanic
                    activity resulted in the formation of a volcanic arc that extended
                    from Canada to Scotland<sup>5</sup>. Within the past 25 million years, a
                    stationary hotspot located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge beneath Iceland
                    caused the crust to bulge out above sea level<sup>5</sup>, transforming a
                    submarine plateau into a viable landform<sup>6, 11</sup>. Geologists first
                    discovered the hotspot in Iceland due to the island's highly irregular
                    volcanic activity<sup>5</sup>. Although volcanic activity from the hotspot
                    continues to the present day, it has reduced in scale significantly
                    since its inception 60 million years ago and is no longer capable of
                    creating new landforms<sup>11</sup>. Currently, the oldest rocks exposed on
                    Iceland’s surface range from 14 to 16 million years old<sup>11</sup>.
                    <br><br>
                    In recent times, Iceland has experienced significant glacial activity,
                    with 22 distinct glacial and interglacial cycles occurring over the
                    past 3 million years<sup>12</sup>. These cycles correspond to periods of substantial
                    glacial expansion and subsequent retreat, caused by fluctuations in
                    global temperature<sup>12</sup>. The initial glacial foundational phase was
                    initiated approximately 4 million years ago and was followed by a
                    transitional growth phase, resulting in a unified Icelandic ice sheet
                    covering the Island<sup>5</sup>. Over the next million years, this ice sheet
                    fragmented and melted, leaving behind smaller ice deposits across
                    the country<sup>5</sup>.
                    <br><br>
                    The most recent major glacial event in Iceland is the Little Ice Age,
                    a global cooling phenomenon that took place between the 1300s and
                    mid-1800s<sup>5</sup>. As average temperatures dropped, glaciers significantly
                    expanded in mass, and sea ice surrounded Iceland<sup>6</sup>. This was the last
                    major glacial event in the island’s history.
                    <br><br>
                    Iceland is characterized by numerous natural phenomena that can be
                    attributed to its distinctive origins. Due to Iceland’s relatively
                    youthful geological history, geologists and historians alike have had
                    the opportunity to thoroughly investigate and study its origins.
